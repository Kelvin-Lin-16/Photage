# Photage
## 1) Describe the architecture of our current application: Photage is a  a photo collage application using camera roll and instagram images. Login through  instagram, email, or guest. We update collage layouts in the application from an backend server. The apps makes collages with text dropping, frame overlays, and cropping. Save or Share on social media. The user may order the collage as prints, in which case all order information is placed in app and sent to our order server for processing. 


## 2) Create an x-code project that does the following ( UI does not matter, only functionality):

Logs into instagram.
Pulls 10 images from instagram.
Crops one of the images.
Packs the images and cropped image to a zipfile.
Uploads the zip file to AWS.
